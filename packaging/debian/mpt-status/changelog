    already a running daemon (Closes: #401580)

    stopped which according to lsb standards should exit with error
    code 0

    other daemons later, while the first one is defunct and waits for
    the sleep call to exit afterwards (Closes: #401554)
  * Remove the check for the "/proc/scsi/mptspi" directory, as there
    might be others in use instead of this one, however the version
    check should be enough and exits gracefully (see #387963)
  * Include check_daemon() function to check if there is already a
    running mpt-statusd which is not timing out at the moment
  * Gracefully exit with code 0 after the run of start-stop-daemon

    with enough tests and access to hardware
