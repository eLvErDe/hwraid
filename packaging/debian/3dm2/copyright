  Carefully read this Software License Agreement. Installing or using this
  software (the "Software") and the related documentation, (the

  License Agreement. If you do not agree with it, promptly
  return the Software and we will refund the purchase price.

  Software License Agreement
  THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED HEREIN IS PROPRIETARY TO LSI
  CORPORATION AND ITS LICENSORS. LSI CORPORATION IS WILLING TO LICENSE THE
  SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION TO YOU ONLY UPON THE CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT
  ALL OF THE TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT. BY USING
  THIS SOFTWARE, YOU, THE END-USER, AGREE TO THE LICENSE TERMS BELOW. IF YOU
  DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.

  1. Grant of License
  Conditioned upon compliance with the terms and conditions of this Software
  License Agreement ("Agreement"), LSI Corporation ("LSI") grants you, the
  original licensee, a nonexclusive and nontransferable limited license to
  use (including installation on multiple computers) for your internal
  business purposes the Software and the Documentation, ("Permitted Use").

  2. License Conditions; Confidentiality
  The Software and Documentation are confidential information of LSI and its
  licensors. Except as expressly permitted herein, you may not disclose or
  give copies of the Software or Documentation to others and you may not let
  others gain access to the same. You may not post the Software or
  Documentation, or otherwise make available, in any form, on the Internet or
  in other public places or media. You may not modify, adapt, translate,
  rent, lease, loan, distribute or resell for profit, or create derivative
  works based upon, the Software or Documentation or any part of thereof, but
  you may transfer the original media containing the Software and
  Documentation on a one-time basis provided you retain no copies of the
  Software and Documentation and the recipient assumes all of the terms of
  this Agreement. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or
  otherwise attempt to derive source code from the Software except to the
  extent allowed by law.

  3. No Warranty
  LSI grants a limited warranty only to the original licensee, that the
  Software will perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation
  prepared by LSI for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt
  by the original licensee. LSI's entire liability and the licensee's
  exclusive remedy for breach of the limited warranty above shall be, at
  LSI's sole option and discretion, either: (a) the repair or replacement of
  the non-conforming Software which is returned to LSI and determined by LSI
  to be non-conforming, or (b) the return of the price the original licensee
  paid solely for the Software. This limited warranty is void if the
  non-conformance of the Software results from accident, abuse, negligence,
  misapplication, or failure to use the Software in accordance with the
  Documentation. Any replacement Software will be warranted to the original
  licensee for the remainder of the original warranty period, or thirty (30)
  days, whichever is longer. EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED EXPRESSLY IN THIS LIMITED
  WARRANTY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND
  WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION
  OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
  SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INTERFERENCE, ACCURACY OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT,
  OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, LAW, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE, ARE
  HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND ARE EXPRESSLY
  DISCLAIMED BY LSI, ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS. TO THE EXTENT AN IMPLIED
  WARRANTY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE
  EXPRESS WARRANTY PERIOD. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
  LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY
  NOT APPLY. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO
  HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. This
  disclaimer and exclusion shall apply even if the express warranty set forth
  above fails of its essential purpose.

  4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND REMEDIES
  IN NO EVENT SHALL LSI OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT,
  CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM THIS
  AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, DAMAGE FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION,
  LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS),
  WHETHER RESULTING FROM LSI'S NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LSI WAS
  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LSI'S MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR ANY
  DAMAGES ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND
  DOCUMENTATION WILL NOT EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LICENSE FEES YOU PAID
  TO LSI FOR THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION. THE LAWS OF SOME JURISDICTIONS
  DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, AND THE ABOVE
  EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  5. U.S. Government End User Purchasers
  The Software and Documentation qualify as "commercial items," as that term
  is defined at Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") (48 C.F.R.) 2.101,
  consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer
  software documentation" as such terms are used in FAR 12.212. Consistent
  with FAR 12.212 and DoD FAR Supp. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, and
  notwithstanding any other FAR or other contractual clause to the contrary,
  you may provide to Government end user or, if this Agreement is direct,
  Government end user will acquire, the Software and Documentation with only
  those rights set forth in this Agreement. Use of either the Software or
  Documentation or both constitutes agreement by the Government that the
  Software and Documentation are "commercial computer software" and
  "commercial computer software documentation," and constitutes acceptance of
  the rights and restrictions herein.

  6. Term And Termination
  You may terminate this Agreement at any time, and it will automatically
  terminate if you fail to comply with it. If terminated, you must
  immediately destroy the Documentation and the Software and all copies you
  have made.

  7. Audit Rights
  LSI shall have the right on reasonable notice, at its own cost and no more
  than once per year, directly or through its independent auditors, to
  inspect, examine, take extracts, and make copies from, your records to the
  extent reasonably necessary to verify your compliance with the terms and
  conditions of this Agreement. This right shall apply during the term of
  this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter.

  8. Export
  You may not export this Software or Documentation, unless you have complied
  with applicable United States and foreign government laws.

  9. General
  You assume full responsibility for the legal and responsible use of the
  Software and Documentation. You agree that this Agreement is the complete
  agreement between you and LSI (and that any verbal or written statements
  that are not reflected in this Agreement and any prior agreements, are
  superseded by this Agreement). To be effective, any amendment of this
  Agreement must be in writing and signed by both you and LSI. Should any
  provisions of this Agreement be held to be unenforceable, then such
  provision shall be separable from this Agreement and shall not affect the
  remainder of the Agreement. This Agreement shall be governed by California
  law, not including its choice of law provisions. The United Nations
  Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall not be applied to this
  Agreement. All rights in the Software and Documentation not specifically
  granted in this Agreement are reserved by LSI or its licensors. The English
  language version of this Agreement shall be the official version. The terms
  and conditions of this Software License Agreement shall be binding upon you
  and your respective heirs, successors and assigns.

  10. Survival
